The Hidden Cost of War
=======

Many people don't realize (or rarely consider) that the cost of war isn't just the number of men/women lost.

Truely, there are so many casualties of war:

+ Properties Losses
  - Buildings Razed
  - Lost Territory
  - Ground Salted
+ Financial Losses
  - Lost Investments
  - Wealth Stolen 
  - War Bonds Never Repaid
+ Industry Losses
  - Repurposing Factories (pre, during, and post war)
  - Destroyed Equipment
  - Innovative War Machines
+ Human Losses
  - Lost Intellect
  - Future Reproduction Potential
  - Current Production

I focused on the last point. I was curious as to why the south *still* has never truely recovered from the civil war, or why (former) East Germany, still had not recovered. Finally, is it even possible for North Korea to recover. 

Honestly, after a fair amount of analysis. The answer is probably no.
